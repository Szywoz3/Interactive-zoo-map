distribution: Russian Far East (Sikhote-Alin, Amur River valley), northeastern China, small populations near the border with North Korea</br>
habitat: dense deciduous, mixed, and coniferous forests, often near rivers and streams; cold or temperate climates</br>
diet: hoofed mammals (deer, wild boar, elk, musk deer), birds, sometimes smaller animals, and occasionally fish</br>

The Siberian tiger is the largest and most powerful subspecies of tiger. Males can reach a body weight of up to about 300 kg, while females are much smaller. The total body length (including the tail) of males exceeds 3 meters, and is shorter in females. The winter coat is very long and dense to protect against frost, while in summer it becomes shorter and thinner.</br>

It lives a solitary and highly territorial life, requiring a large hunting range depending on prey availability. Mating can occur throughout the year, and gestation lasts about 103–112 days. The female usually gives birth to 2–6 cubs, which stay with their mother for around 2–3 years.</br>

In the wild, Siberian tigers typically live up to about 15 years, but can live longer in captivity. The population of this species is endangered — the main threats include poaching, habitat loss, and depletion of the prey base.</br>
