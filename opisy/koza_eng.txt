Description:
One of the oldest domesticated animals (alongside the sheep) — domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the regions of the Middle East, Mongolia, Southeast Asia, and India.

Goats have well-developed vision that allows them to distinguish colors such as yellow, orange, violet, and green.

They possess an excellent sense of smell and taste, and can distinguish bitter, salty, sweet, and sour flavors.
They also have very good eyesight and often sniff new food before eating it.

Goats are social herd animals with a clear hierarchy.
Headbutting and horn clashes are a form of fighting for dominance and status within the group.</br>

RED LIST STATUS:
