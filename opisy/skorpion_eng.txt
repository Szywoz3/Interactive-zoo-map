There are about 600 known species of scorpions.
Most occur in desert and semi-desert areas.
The flattened body of a scorpion ends with a venom gland.
Only 24 species have venom dangerous to humans. They hunt insects, spiders, and other arthropods.
They are nocturnal. The female gives birth to 20–30 young and carries them on her back for 3 weeks.</br>
