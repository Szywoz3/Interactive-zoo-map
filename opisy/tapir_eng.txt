Its short trunk is a nose fused with the upper lip. It functions as a “snorkel,” allowing the tapir to breathe while the rest of its body is submerged in water; it also helps in grasping and pulling food.

They are excellent swimmers and divers. When threatened, they hide in water and can remain submerged for several minutes.

Young individuals have characteristic striped and spotted coats that help with camouflage. The stripes and spots disappear with age.

Tapirs are related to zebras and rhinoceroses; like them, tapirs are odd-toed ungulates.</br>
