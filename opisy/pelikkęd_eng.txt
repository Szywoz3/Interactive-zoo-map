lat. Pelecanus crispus</br>

Pelicans are excellent swimmers.
They have a webbed membrane connecting all toes and a characteristic skin pouch under the lower jaw.

Their beak measures up to 50 cm.

They hunt collectively, forming a semicircle on the water surface and driving schools of fish into the shallows, where they surround them and scoop them out of the water.

They nest in large colonies.
In the Poznań Zoo they reproduce regularly.

They eat about 1 kilogram of fish per day.</br>
