Also known as the palm civet.

It is an excellent climber, capable of moving even along very thin branches. It is nocturnal, and its exceptional eyesight and hearing make it a skilled hunter.

Its pointed snout, ending with sharp teeth, helps both in self-defense and in reaching favorite foods such as bird eggs and fruits.

For shelter, it uses abandoned bird nests and tree hollows.</br>
