It is endemic to the island of Montserrat, meaning it does not occur anywhere else in the world. It is estimated that no more than 460 individuals remain in the wild.

It is the symbol of Montserrat. The species’ range is very small, limited to only 102 km².

This species shows sexual dimorphism. Females have mainly greenish-yellow and olive plumage, while males are black with a yellow-orange belly.

It is monogamous – finding a partner for life. The future mother builds a hanging basket-shaped nest by herself, without help from the male.</br>
