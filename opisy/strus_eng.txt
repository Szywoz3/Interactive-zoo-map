The idea that ostriches bury their heads in the sand when threatened is a myth. It most likely comes from the fact that ostriches, when facing danger, lay their head and neck flat on the ground.

They utilize the water contained in the plants they eat. They also have salt glands, similar to those of seabirds, which allow them to drink saltwater.

A male has several partners, who lay eggs in a nest prepared on the ground. After the females lay the eggs, the male takes care of incubating and raising the chicks.

They are flightless, but have powerful wings that allow them to quickly change direction while running.

Ostrich eggs are the largest bird eggs. They can weigh up to 1.5 kg, with a volume equivalent to thirty chicken eggs.</br>
