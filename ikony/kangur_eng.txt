The tail serves as a support and helps maintain balance. The kangaroo can make jumps of up to 9 meters, and over short distances can reach speeds of up to 48 km/h.

Females fight for dominance in the group. Rivals stand facing each other, trying to knock each other out. With their strong legs, they can kick hard and inflict serious wounds.

After about 33 days of pregnancy, the female gives birth to a single young (about 3 cm long), which climbs into the pouch and stays there for about 10 months.

Alongside the red kangaroo, the eastern grey kangaroo is one of the largest living marsupials. It is endemic to the Australian continent.</br>
