The largest member of the lemur family and at the same time the most endangered of extinction.

It communicates with the help of distinctive and sometimes very loud sounds.

Unlike other lemurs, the female leaves her young in a nest and, when necessary, carries them in her mouth rather than on her belly or back.

Its long tail helps maintain balance while running and leaping through the treetops.</br>
