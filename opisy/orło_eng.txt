Occurrence / Reintroduction

It builds its nests exclusively on rock ledges or sometimes in caves (up to 7,000 m above sea level).

Its strong digestive system is perfectly adapted to eating bones. It swallows them whole or breaks them into smaller pieces by dropping them from cliffs. Sometimes it cracks bones to eat them.
