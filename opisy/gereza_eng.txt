lat. Colobus polykomos</br>
de. Weißbart-Stummelaffe</br>
ua. Король колобус</br>

Distribution: Ivory Coast, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Sierra Leone</br>

Habitat: Dense tropical forests — both mountain and lowland</br>

Diet: Mainly leaves and buds, also fruits and flowers</br>

The hands of the colobus have only four fingers — the thumb is highly reduced. This is an anatomical adaptation that allows fast movement through the treetops.

They lead a diurnal and arboreal lifestyle but sometimes descend to the ground in search of food.

They have long, white tails ending in a fluffy tuft (from 52 to 100 cm).

These monkeys live in groups of several individuals. Although adults are black and white, young colobus monkeys are born completely white.</br>
