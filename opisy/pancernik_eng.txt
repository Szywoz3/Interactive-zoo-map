It has strong limbs ending in sharp claws, which are used for digging burrows, finding food, and defending against predators.
While underground, it can breathe using the small amount of oxygen trapped between soil particles.

Its hard armor provides excellent protection from predators.
It consists of about 18 rows of bony plates, some of which are movable, allowing the animal to curl up.

Its name comes from its distinctive thick fur — much denser than that of other armadillo species.</br>
