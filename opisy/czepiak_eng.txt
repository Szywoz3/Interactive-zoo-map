Habitat: evergreen rainforests, deciduous and semi-deciduous forests, mangrove swamps</br>

Diet: fruits, leaves of trees and shrubs, grass tips, bark, twigs, and stems</br>

Hands with four fingers allow agile and quick swinging from tree branches. They do not have a thumb – balance is aided by the tail.

They have a long, prehensile tail that can reach up to 85 cm. Using this “fifth limb,” the spider monkey can lift objects and stabilize itself while moving through trees.

It can also hang from its tail, supporting its entire body weight.

They live in family groups; each group has its own territory, which they traverse using arboreal pathways. Sometimes they descend to the ground, where they can walk and run well on two legs.

They communicate using a wide range of sounds. Each monkey’s calls differ slightly, allowing individual recognition over distances.</br>
