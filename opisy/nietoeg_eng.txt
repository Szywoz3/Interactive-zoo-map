lat. Rousettus aegyptiacus</br>
de. Agyptischer Flughund</br>

The Egyptian fruit bat is the only member of the megabat family capable of using echolocation.

Unlike most bats, it does not produce sounds with its larynx — instead, it clicks its tongue to navigate in the dark.
After dusk, it leaves its roost to search for fruits and flower nectar, often traveling several dozen kilometers in one night.
It can live up to 20 years.</br>
