The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera.
Males are distinguished by their impressive manes — their color and size may signal health and strength.
Lions live in family groups called prides, consisting of several females, their offspring, and sometimes a few males.
Females often hunt together, mainly preying on medium-sized hoofed animals.
Females usually give birth to 1–4 cubs (sometimes more) after about 110 days of gestation.
In the wild, lions can live around 10–14 years, but often longer in zoos (depending on conditions).
Lion populations are declining due to habitat loss, human conflict, and hunting.</br>
