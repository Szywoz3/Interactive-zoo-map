Unlike most other deer species, the fawns of Javan deer are not covered with spots.

Although introduced to new territories, the population on its native islands continues to decline. The species is now listed as Vulnerable and is protected under Indonesian law.

In the wild, Javan deer rarely drink water directly — they obtain moisture from the plants and leaves they eat.

Males have strongly branched antlers, which can weigh up to about 2.5 kg — a remarkable weight compared to their body size.</br>
