Due to hunting, they were almost completely extinct, but their numbers are now increasing thanks to reintroductions and protection.
Males are territorial – they guard the area where a herd of females grazes. Young males live in separate groups.

Like the blue wildebeest, they migrate in herds. Due to their characteristic white tail, they are also called white-tailed wildebeests.</br>
