Domesticated earlier than the horse — around 4000 BCE in the region of the Lower Nile.

Thanks to its low nutritional requirements, the donkey has long been used primarily as a pack animal, well adapted to mountainous terrain.

In the wild, donkeys are found in Africa, and their ancestor is believed to be the Somali wild ass.
Over the course of nearly 6,000 years, more than 70 breeds of donkeys have been developed.

Donkeys live in herds of about 10–15 individuals.
A herd is usually led by an experienced female, and individual donkeys can live up to 40 years.</br>
