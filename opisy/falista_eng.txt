The budgerigar owes its name to the wave-like pattern of its black-edged feathers.

The color of the cere (the fleshy area above the beak) indicates the bird’s sex — blue in males and brown in females.

In the wild, they live in large flocks, moving constantly in search of food and water.

They breed after periods of heavy rainfall, when food is plentiful.
Nesting takes place in tree hollows or rock crevices.
The female lays 4–6 eggs, which she incubates for about 18 days.

Their characteristic “chirp-chirp” sound is used for communication within the flock.
Budgerigars are among the most popular companion birds kept by humans, originally native to Australia.</br>
