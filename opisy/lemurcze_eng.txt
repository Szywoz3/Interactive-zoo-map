lat. Eulemur rubriventer</br> 
de. Rotbauchmaki</br> 

Distribution: Madagascar</br> 

Habitat: montane rainforests</br> 

Diet: leaves, fruits, nectar, and flowers</br> 

Another commonly used name for this species is the Red-bellied Lemur.
By feeding on nectar from various plants, it also pollinates them (including the baobab). It is active both during the day and at night.

During the first month of life, the mother carries the young on her belly; later she passes them to the male, who carries them on his back. They can live up to 20 years.

Due to illegal hunting and deforestation of Madagascar’s rainforests, they are threatened with extinction.</br>
