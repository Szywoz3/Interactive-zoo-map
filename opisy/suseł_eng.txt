They often stand on their hind legs, carefully observing their surroundings.
When they notice danger, they warn the rest of the colony with a loud sound, then hide in their burrow.
The Moravian ground squirrels became extinct in Poland (in the 1970s). Thanks to the efforts of PTOP Salamandra, UAM, and our zoo, the process of reintroducing ground squirrels in Poland has been ongoing since 2005.

They hibernate from October to March. They are able to survive the winter thanks to fat reserves accumulated in summer and early autumn. Each individual hibernates alone, in a separate burrow.

Ground squirrels live in large colonies, ranging from several dozen to several hundred individuals. Long vibrissae (sensory hairs) help them navigate the long underground tunnels.</br>
