The African pygmy mouse places small stones at the entrance of its burrow — dew that collects on them provides a source of drinking water.

It lives in pairs or small groups near water bodies or in tall grass.

It is a nocturnal animal — during the day, it sleeps in its burrow and becomes active after dusk.
