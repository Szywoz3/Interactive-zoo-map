Habitat: Dense forests and abandoned plantations</br>

Also commonly known as the margay.

It can rotate its ankle joint by 180°, allowing it to grasp branches with both its front and hind paws. These flexible joints enable it to climb down trees headfirst — unlike most felines.

It spends most of its time resting in tree canopies. It can leap quickly from branch to branch while chasing prey. Its tail helps maintain balance.

Remains of this species found in the southern United States suggest that the historical range of the margay was much larger.

The margay population has declined significantly over the past 30 years, mainly due to trapping and habitat loss caused by deforestation.</br>
