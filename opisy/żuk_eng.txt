lat. Pachnoda aemula</br>

Beetles - Insects</br>

Africa</br>

A large, beautifully colored beetle.
After mating, the female lays white, round eggs in the soil.
Grub-like larvae hatch from them, which grow quickly, feeding on humus and fruits.
The mature larva builds a hard cocoon in the ground, called a coenobium, in which it pupates. There, the pupa transforms into the adult insect, called imago.
The beetles feed on petals and fruits.</br>
