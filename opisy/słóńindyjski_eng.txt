The Indian elephant is one of the three living subspecies of the Asian elephant. It is smaller than the African elephant, with a straighter or slightly arched back, and its highest body point is located on the head.

Males are significantly larger than females — they reach a shoulder height of 2.7 to 3 meters and can weigh several tons. Females are smaller and less frequently have tusks. The skin of the Indian elephant is gray, relatively smooth, and often marked with light patches of depigmented skin, especially on the ears, trunk, and head.

The gestation period lasts about 18–22 months, and the female usually gives birth to one calf every 4–5 years. In the wild, Indian elephants can live up to 60 years.

They are social animals, living in herds composed mainly of females and their young, led by an experienced matriarch. Adult males often live solitary lives, joining herds only during the mating season.

The Indian elephant holds great cultural significance — for thousands of years it has been used for work, transport, and in religious ceremonies. In India, it is a protected species, and since 1992 the government program “Project Elephant” has aimed to protect populations, habitats, and migration corridors of these animals.</br>
