lat. Tamandua tetradactyla</br>
eng. Southern tamandua</br>
de. Südlicher Tamandua</br>
ua. Таманду американський</br>

distribution: South America</br>

habitat: forests and wooded areas (both in tropical and drier climates)</br>

diet: ants and termites (including arboreal colonies), sometimes bees, additionally fruits.</br>

They use four powerful claws on each front paw to dig out anthills and termite mounds. These claws are also useful for defense.

The southern and northern tamanduas belong to the anteater family. Unlike the larger member of this family, the giant anteater, they spend most of the day in trees. Their long prehensile tail helps them move along tree branches.

Tamanduas are more active at dusk; they sleep most of the day on tree branches, in tree cavities, or sometimes in burrows dug by other animals. They lead a solitary lifestyle.

They catch insects with their narrow, elongated snout and a forty-centimeter-long tongue covered with sticky saliva.</br>
