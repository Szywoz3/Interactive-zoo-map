lat. Myriapoda</br>


The class of centipedes and millipedes includes terrestrial arthropods with worm-like bodies covered by a hard chitinous exoskeleton.
Their bodies, ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters in length, consist of a head and numerous undifferentiated segments equipped with one or two pairs of walking legs.
They are nocturnal.
They live under bark, stones, and leaf litter. Some myriapods are predatory, while others are herbivorous. In Poland, species include the wood centipede, soil millipede, and Julus.</br>
