Insects (Insecta) are a class of arthropods and represent the most diverse group of animals in terms of species number. They inhabit all terrestrial environments, and some have also adapted to life in water. They were the first animals to develop the ability for active flight.
The sizes of insects range from 0.25 mm to over 350 mm. In Poland, the most numerous orders are butterflies, beetles, hymenopterans, and flies.
Insects play key roles in nature:
Pollination – e.g., honeybees.
Decomposition of organic matter – e.g., dung beetles.
Food chain – they serve as food for many animals.
Among insects, there are different groups:
Predatory – e.g., mantises, which hunt other insects.
Social – e.g., bees, ants, termites, which live in organized colonies.
The oldest insect fossils date back to the early Devonian, about 396 million years ago. Insects probably originated even earlier, in the Silurian.
The study of insects is called entomology. Due to the vast number of species, insects are intensively studied in terms of their biology, ecology, and ecological importance.</br>
