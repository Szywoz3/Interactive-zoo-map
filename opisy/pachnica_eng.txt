lat. Osmoderma eremita</br>

The hermit beetle is a large, brown beetle.

Adult beetles live inside tree hollows. On sunny days, they can be found on tree trunks, where they emit a characteristic smell (hence the name).

They inhabit bright deciduous forests and roadside alleys.

They live in old deciduous trees, where larvae develop in decaying wood, feeding on rotting material.

The hermit beetle is an umbrella species, meaning it is threatened with extinction due to the loss and reduction of its natural habitats. Protecting it also helps conserve many other species associated with hollow trees.

The Poznań Zoo has been breeding hermit beetles since the year 2000, in cooperation with the Nature Conservation Centre in the Łopuchówko Forest District.</br>
