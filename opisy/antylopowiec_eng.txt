Sable antelopes chew on the bones of other animals to replenish salt and mineral deficiencies in their bodies.

This species shows sexual dimorphism, meaning clear differences in appearance between males and females. Males have black coats, while females are brown. Both sexes have long, curved horns.

They defend themselves with their horns. Males fighting for dominance rarely get seriously injured, although sable antelopes can fatally wound a predator attacking them.

Females with young form herds of up to 30 individuals, led by a single male.

Young males are driven out of the herd at about 3 years of age.</br>
