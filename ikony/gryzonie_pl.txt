
Rodents (order Rodents, Rodentia) are mammals defined by the presence of a single pair of continuously growing incisors in both the upper and lower jaws. 
They make up about 40% of all mammal species. 
Rodents inhabit nearly every terrestrial habitat except Antarctica and have adapted to a wide variety of lifestyles—including arboreal (tree-living), fossorial (burrowing), semi-aquatic, and even human-modified environments. 
Key features include:
a gap (diastema) between incisors and cheek teeth, as they lack canines</br>
strong gnawing incisors that must be kept short by gnawing on hard substrates</br> 
predominantly herbivorous or seed-eating diets, though some are omnivorous or even predatory in rare cases</br>
Rodents also play important roles for humans: as pets, laboratory animals, and in some cases as pests and disease vectors.</br>
