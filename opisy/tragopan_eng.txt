Distribution: Himalayas at altitudes of 2,450–4,250 m above sea level. In winter, it descends to lower mountain areas.</br>

Habitat: oak and rhododendron forests on steep mountain slopes.</br>

Diet: mainly green parts of plants and seeds; also eats insects and small vertebrates.</br>

It shows clear sexual dimorphism — males are more colorful. During the courtship display, males inflate bright blue fleshy horns on their heads resembling those of mythical satyrs (hence the name).

Unlike most pheasants and ground-dwelling birds, tragopans spend much of their time in trees, where they also build their nests.

They often use abandoned nests of larger bird species.</br>
