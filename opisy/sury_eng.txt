Distribution: Southern Africa</br>

Habitat: deserts, savannas, and mountainous areas</br>

Diet: insects, spiders, scorpions, rodents, and small snakes</br>

Meerkats have a high resistance to the venom of many species of snakes and scorpions.

They are excellent diggers, creating complex burrow systems with many exits that can reach up to 5 meters underground.

While searching for food, the group always has sentinels on guard. When danger is spotted, they bark or whistle to alert others to the type of threat.

Thanks to the “black goggles” around their eyes, a meerkat standing upright on its hind legs (and supported by its tail) can spot a predator from a distance of up to 300 meters.</br>
