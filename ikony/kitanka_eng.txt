lat. Trichosurus vulpecula</br>
de. Fuchskusu</br>

Herbivorous mammal.
It leads a nocturnal, partially arboreal lifestyle. As a marsupial, its young spend the first five months in the mother’s pouch, where they nurse and grow rapidly.

It feeds mainly on plants and occasionally on insects. Its prehensile tail is hairless on the underside — this structure improves grip and aids in climbing.

It is a solitary animal, maintaining distance from others through scent marking.
It sleeps in tree hollows and rock crevices, often competing with other possums for shelter sites.</br>
