lat. Bettongia penicillata</br>
de. Bürstenschwanz-Rattenkänguru</br>

It is a marsupial that leads a nocturnal lifestyle.
It is distinguished by its unique diet, consisting mainly of dug-up fungi, resin, seeds, and tubers.
It does not eat green plant parts and can survive without access to water. Fat reserves are stored in its tail.

It builds its own nest, lining it with grass and leaves. It carries nesting materials pressed against its belly with its front paws.
This shelter serves as a resting place, not for raising young — after birth, the young hide in the mother’s pouch, where they nurse and grow rapidly.</br>
