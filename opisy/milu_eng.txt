This species has been reintroduced in semi-wild breeding programs.

Like most deer, males shed their antlers. Occasionally, a second, smaller set of antlers grows after the first is shed — these are lost again after a few weeks.

Despite their robust build, they are excellent swimmers and enjoy spending much of their time partially submerged in water.

In zoos, their average lifespan is estimated at 23–25 years.

RED LIST:</br>
