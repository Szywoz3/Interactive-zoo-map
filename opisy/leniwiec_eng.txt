Distribution: South America</br>

Habitat: mixed forests and jungles</br>

Diet: mainly leaves, fruits, sometimes bird eggs</br>

Among the Indigenous peoples of South America, it is called unau.

It spends most of its time hanging from tree branches with its back facing downward.
No more than once a week, it descends to the ground in order to… defecate.

Its fur consists of two layers: a short woolly undercoat and longer hairs directed toward the back.
The color is grayish-brown, and algae often grow on it, giving it a greenish tint that provides additional camouflage.

Its limbs have two fingers ending in hook-shaped claws. It is also an excellent swimmer.</br>
