lat. Capra nubiana</br>
de. Syrischer Steinbock</br>

Distribution: Egypt, Sudan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Israel, Jordan</br>

Habitat: Rocky, desert mountains, often with very steep slopes</br>

Diet: Mainly leaves and grasses</br>

One of the main threats to the Nubian ibex is habitat loss caused by tourism development, road construction, and the presence of predators such as leopards and bearded vultures.

Both males and females have horns, though those of the females are much smaller. In males, they can reach up to one meter in length.

Despite living in desert environments, daily access to water is very important for these animals.

Their short, smooth coat reflects much of the sunlight, allowing them to remain active during the day, even in extreme heat.</br>
