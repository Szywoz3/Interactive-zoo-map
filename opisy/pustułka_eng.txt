The Polish name comes from the Russian word "pustoj" ("fool"). Kestrels hunt differently from other birds of prey, which made them difficult to train for falconry.

Excellent eyesight allows them to spot prey from heights of 20–30 m. During hunting, the kestrel can hover in the air. Once it spots its prey, it dives and slows down just above the ground.

It can see UV radiation like many other birds of prey, and uses it specifically to locate rodent urine marks left near nests and burrows.

This species is monogamous. For nesting, it uses abandoned nests of other birds of prey and corvids, as well as rock crevices and ledges of urban infrastructure.</br>
