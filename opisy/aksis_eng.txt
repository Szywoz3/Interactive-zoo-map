lat. Axis kuhlii</br>
de. Bawean Hirsch</br>
ua. аксис бавеанський</br>

Distribution: Bawean Island in Indonesia</br>
Habitat: thickets and forests with dense undergrowth</br>
Diet: grass, leaves, and herbaceous plants</br>

It occurs only on the tiny (150 km²) island of Bawean. For comparison, the area of Poznań is 262 km².
No more than 500 individuals live in the wild.
It is nocturnal — it looks for food and moves around at night. During the day, it rests, hiding in the thickets from predators.
It lives alone, in pairs, or in small groups. Unlike most deer species, young Bawean deer do not have spots.
During escape, the male always runs in front, the female behind, and the young move in the middle of the group, which provides protection from both sides.</br>
