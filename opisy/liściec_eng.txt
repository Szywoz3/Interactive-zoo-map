A herbivorous insect about 8 cm long.
It resembles its surroundings in color and shape (a phenomenon called mimicry) to protect itself from natural enemies.
Thanks to the strong flattening of its body and legs, as well as the venation and color of its wings, it imitates a leaf.
Even the eggs, when laid in the soil, resemble plant seeds in shape. It undergoes incomplete metamorphosis.
Its favorite food is blackberry leaves.</br>
