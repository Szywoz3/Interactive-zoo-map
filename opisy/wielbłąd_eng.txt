lat. Camelus bactrianus</br>
eng. Bactrian camel</br>

The Bactrian camel, also called the two-humped camel,</br>

has adapted to living in the harsh conditions of the desert.</br>

The humps store food reserves in the form of fat – up to 40 kg! Thanks to this, it can survive without food for several days. It can drink up to 120 liters of water at one time.
The camel’s eyes are protected from sand by long, curly eyelashes. It also has a "third" eyelid that removes excess sand. The nose can be closed with special muscles, preventing sand from entering the nostrils.
Another adaptation for desert life is the structure of its feet: two large toes connected together form a wide surface, preventing the animal from sinking into the sand. Thick skin "pads" on the ankle and wrist joints as well as on the chest protect against burns.</br>
