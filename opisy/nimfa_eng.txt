Distribution: Australia</br>

Diet: grass, seeds, fruits, insects</br>

Despite its small size, it is related to the cockatoos.

They obtain water from dew that collects on leaves and flowers. Their diet is also supplemented with small fruits.

For camouflage, they spend most of their time on dry branches (without leaves) or on the ground.

Cockatiels often preen each other, cleaning the back, tail, and wings while keeping the head raised.</br>
