Although capable of flight, it usually moves by walking or running. It uses its wings mainly to escape approaching danger.

It lives in small groups, usually consisting of one male and several females. It is active during the day and forages in the morning and evening.

The nest is built on the ground. Females and chicks protect themselves from predators thanks to their camouflaging brown-gray plumage.

During courtship, the red coloration on the male’s head becomes brighter and more vivid. Outside the breeding season, it remains darker and duller.</br>
