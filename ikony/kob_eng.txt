Adult males are highly territorial. Young males, when they reach the age at which their horns start to grow, are driven out of the herd and form bachelor groups.
The bright ring on their rump serves a role similar to a “mirror” in deer – it helps the herd stay together. They live near water sources. Water serves as a refuge for waterbucks – they run into it to escape predators.</br>
