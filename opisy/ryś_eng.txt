lat. Lynx lynx</br>
de. Nordluchs</br>

During the day, it rests in a hidden shelter, coming out to hunt only at dusk. After catching its prey, the lynx hides the remains for the next few days, covering them with leaves, sand, or snow using its hind paws.

The tufts of hair on the tips of its ears help focus sound waves and direct them into the ears, greatly enhancing its hearing.

It also has excellent eyesight — it can spot a mouse from 70 meters away and a grazing deer from more than half a kilometer.

The lynx climbs trees skillfully and jumps very well, but it is not a long-distance runner and tires quickly.

Since 1995, the lynx has been a protected species in Poland and is listed in the Polish Red Book of Animals.

Since 2007, successful reintroduction efforts have been carried out in the Pisz Forest.
