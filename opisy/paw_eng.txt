This species exhibits sexual dimorphism, meaning clear differences in appearance between sexes. Males are distinguished by their multicolored plumage, colorful crest on the head, and large ornate train. Females are smaller, with brown-white plumage and some green on the head and crest.

Peafowl are strong fliers, but spend most of their time on the ground foraging. They spend the night in groups, sleeping high on tree branches, poles, or roofs.

In many cultures and beliefs, they are considered sacred animals. Some deities are depicted as peacocks or with a peacock feather as a sacred attribute.

Both sexes can produce loud mating calls, audible over long distances. The female selects a male based on the size of the train, the number, size, and arrangement of the "eye" patterns.</br>
