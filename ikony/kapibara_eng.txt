It is the largest rodent in the world. It can weigh over 60 kg and reach up to 130 cm in length. It is related to the guinea pig.

It is an excellent swimmer and diver – it can hold its breath for up to 5 minutes. Most of the time it stays close to water sources and hides in dense vegetation. When threatened, it flees into the water.

It lives in groups of up to several dozen individuals.

Capybaras communicate with each other using sounds similar to those made by guinea pigs.

Capybara incisors, like those of other rodents, grow throughout their life and must be constantly worn down while eating. Hard fruits and vegetables help them maintain their teeth.</br>
