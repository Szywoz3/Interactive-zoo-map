Distribution: Africa, Arabian Peninsula, and Asia (India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkmenistan)</br>

Habitat: Savanna, steppes, and deserts</br>

Diet: Small mammals, amphibians, and snakes</br>

The name comes from the Turkish word karakulak (black ear). It is closely related to the lynx, which is why it is also called the steppe lynx.

Their activity (diurnal or nocturnal) depends on their distribution area. At temperatures above +10°C, caracals rest.

In the wild, they are solitary animals – males and females inhabit neighboring territories and form pairs only during the mating season, after which they separate again. In captivity (for example, in zoos), pairs form strong bonds.</br>
