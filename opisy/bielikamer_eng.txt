The body is covered by about 7,000 feathers. When it loses a flight feather on one wing, it also loses the corresponding feather on the other, which helps maintain balance during flight.

Bald eagle nests can weigh up to 2 tons and have a diameter of 2 meters. The largest nest, found in Florida in 1963, measured 3 meters wide and 16 meters deep.

It soars on thermal updrafts, which help it gain speeds of up to 70 km/h.

In most cases, it forms lifelong pairs. Only when one partner dies does the surviving bird find a new mate.</br>
