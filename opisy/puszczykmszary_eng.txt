One of the largest and longest-living owls in the world. In zoos, its age can reach up to 40 years.

It is active both during the day and night. It is an excellent hunter regardless of the amount of available light. This feature can be recognized by its smaller pupil – and thus the visible iris.

It has the largest facial disc of all owls. The facial disc is a round, flat arrangement of feathers on the front of the head that helps collect even the faintest sounds and direct them to the ear opening hidden under the feathers.

Although most of the population inhabits the north, individual and increasingly frequent breeding pairs are also observed in Poland.</br>
