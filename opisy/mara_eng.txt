Maras do not belong to the hare family. They are rodents, although they externally resemble hares or rabbits. They move on all four limbs using a diagonal gait (alternating two right and two left limbs) or by hopping.
They are monogamous animals – they form pairs for life. A new partner is found only if the previous one dies.

Males follow females. A male marks his female partner with urine and also marks the surrounding area with feces, creating a movable territory.
They create “nurseries” in dug burrows. The young of several pairs are guarded and fed by females, who take turns approximately every hour while the rest of the parents forage nearby.</br>
