The brown bear belongs to the bear family (Ursidae). It inhabits vast areas of Europe, Asia, and North America.

Its fur is usually dark brown, although in some subspecies it may be lighter or nearly black.
When standing upright, it can reach a body length of 1.8 to 3 meters, depending on sex and subspecies.
Body weight typically ranges from 80 to 780 kg, depending on region, subspecies, and sex.

Females usually give birth every two years to 2–3 cubs.
Gestation lasts about 8 months, and births often occur between December and February.
In the wild, brown bears usually live 20–30 years, but in captivity they can live up to 50 years.

They are mostly solitary animals, coming together only during the breeding season or when a female cares for her young.
Brown bears are largely omnivorous — plants make up as much as 90% of their diet, although they can also hunt forest animals, catch fish, or feed on carrion.</br>
