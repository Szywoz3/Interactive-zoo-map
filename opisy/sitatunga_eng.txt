This species shows clear sexual dimorphism — males and females differ noticeably in size and appearance.

Adult males are large, have horns, and a dark brown coat. Females are smaller, hornless, and have reddish-golden fur.

Sitatungas often hide in water to escape predators.

Their long, banana-shaped hooves help them move quietly and efficiently across swampy terrain.

They can stand on their hind legs to reach high leaves, and males use their horns to break branches full of food.

Sitatungas communicate through a variety of sounds.
The females’ warning bark can be heard from long distances — even across the swamp.</br>
