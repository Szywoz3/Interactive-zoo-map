Like most mammals, they have 7 cervical vertebrae – these are very large (up to 30 cm long).

Long legs help them defend against predators (giraffes kick). Their eyesight and hearing are highly developed.
Giraffes are tall (males can reach up to 6 m) – an adaptation for eating leaves from trees and shrubs. Their tongue can reach up to 50 cm in length.

The projections on the head are ossicones. Males use them in fights with each other. Ossicones also participate in the thermoregulation of the giraffe’s body.</br>
