The burrowing parrot is also called the Patagonian parrot.
It lives in flocks near watercourses, at altitudes up to 2000 m above sea level.

It nests in tunnels dug into limestone rocks.
Individual corridors can reach up to 3 meters in depth and connect with others to form extensive labyrinths.

Sexual dimorphism is barely visible to the naked eye.
However, the plumage of both sexes differs significantly under UV light (males have brighter green feathers, while females have duller feathers).

The burrowing parrot can increase its body mass and slow down metabolism.
In this way, it conserves energy and can survive cold winters when food is less available.</br>
