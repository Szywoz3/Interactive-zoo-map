Alpacas are excellent climbers, able to move easily across rocky cliffs.
They are highly resistant to changing climatic conditions.

They were domesticated by the Inca around 4,500 years ago.
The Incas used alpaca wool to produce a fabric that was also called alpaca.

They belong to the camelid family, and their ancestor is the vicuña.
Like their relatives, alpacas can spit when they feel threatened or uneasy.

Alpacas are herd animals and must live in the company of other alpacas.</br>
