de. Wildkatze</br>

Distribution: Europe, Caucasus, Asia Minor</br>

European wildcats lead a solitary lifestyle; males and females meet only during the mating season.

Claws, retracted in the paw pads, usually leave no traces. The front paws have five toes.
The inner toe of the front paw is positioned so high that it does not appear in tracks. Therefore, only four toes are visible in the prints of all paws.

The European wildcat is one of four subspecies of Felis silvestris. The others inhabit areas of Africa and Asia.

It hunts at dusk or before dawn in open areas. During the day, it seeks shelter in trees.</br>
