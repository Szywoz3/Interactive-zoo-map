The “ears” visible on eared pheasants are actually feathers arranged in a characteristic way. These birds do not have external ear flaps; their ears are openings on the sides of the head, often covered by contour feathers.

They have strong, heavy beaks perfectly adapted for digging in the soil. Eared pheasants use them to obtain food by uncovering roots and insects.

Both sexes vocalize frequently, and the sounds and songs they produce can be heard from over a kilometer away. Males and females look very similar.

They are often kept as ornamental birds, favored by their interesting appearance and the fact that, like other Galliformes, they rarely take flight.</br>
