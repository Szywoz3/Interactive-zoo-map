Cranes (white-naped and others) are a symbol of good fortune and long life in Asia. Birds and their families live on average 20–30 years.

One of the rarest known birds (white-naped crane) has about 83 individuals.

Flightless white-naped cranes choose a new, separate territory after the breeding season.

During migration, they travel in large groups, but during the breeding season these birds live in pairs, each on its own territory, which they defend.

When they feel threatened, they rise against a powerful opponent. When attacking, they fly downward with their wing, aiming, among other things, at the eyes.</br>
