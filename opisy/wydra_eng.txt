lat. Lutra lutra lutra</br>
de. Fischotter</br>

Distribution: Europe, Asia, and northern Africa</br>

Habitat: Riverbanks, streams, ponds, and lakes</br>

Diet: Fish, occasionally rodents and small birds</br>

Primarily nocturnal, it can hunt for fish even under a thick layer of ice.

On the shore, it builds burrows with entrances located below the water’s surface. In addition to the entrance, the burrow has ventilation holes located under tree roots.

Its swimming speed is enhanced by webbed feet, which allow the otter to “push off” from the water.

In Poland, it occurs throughout the entire country, most commonly in Pomerania, Warmia and Masuria, Podkarpacie, and the Białystok and Łomża regions.</br>
