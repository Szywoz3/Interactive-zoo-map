
PaNocturnal Animals Pavilion is a special part of the New Zoo in Poznań, designed to present species that are active at night or have lifestyles different from the typical diurnal rhythm. This means that the interior of the pavilion simulates dusk or nighttime conditions (with adjusted lighting and shaded areas) so that the animals remain active when visitors can observe them.
The pavilion’s opening hours (in the summer season) are usually 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM, and during peak season up to 6:30 PM. In the winter season, it operates on a shortened schedule — for example, 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM.
The pavilion functions as an integral part of the zoological garden, which is open daily during the season.
In November 2023, the pavilion expanded its collection with two new marsupial species — the brush-tailed bettong and the fat-tailed dunnart (both native to Australia and threatened with extinction).
The pavilion is also part of the zoo’s educational program — for example, in activities such as “From the Children’s Garden to the Tropics,” children and school groups visit the pavilion to learn about the unusual lifestyles of nocturnal animals.
The pavilion allows visitors to observe animals that are normally active at night — providing a unique experience.
It serves an educational purpose, offering exhibitions, meetings, and workshops that teach about animal behavior, adaptations, and the importance of species conservation.
It also enables the display and care of rare species or those with specific environmental requirements (e.g., endangered animals).</br>
