Habitat: humid mountain and lowland forests with dense undergrowth</br>

Diet: no data on diet in the wild; in zoos: insects and their larvae, fruits, vegetables, sprouts, and young plant shoots</br>

Since 2000, no individuals have been documented in their natural habitat.

It is suspected that wild representatives of this species are extinct or that fewer than 250 remain.

This critically endangered species is endemic to Vietnam — it does not occur anywhere else in the world in the wild.

The critical population decline has been caused by hunting, trapping, herbicide spraying during the Vietnam War, and deforestation for agricultural purposes.

This species shows sexual dimorphism — visible differences between sexes. Females are brown, while males are dark blue with a metallic sheen and a white crest.</br>
