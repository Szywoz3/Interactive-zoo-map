The African elephant is the largest living land animal. It has enormous ears that help regulate body temperature. Its trunk ends with two “fingers,” which allow it to grasp objects, collect food and water, and are also used for smelling and communication.

Males can weigh up to 6 tons or more, with a body length (including the trunk) of up to 7.5 meters and a shoulder height of around 3–3.2 meters. Females are smaller.

The gestation period lasts about 22 months, and the female usually gives birth to one calf. Females and young elephants live in herds led by an experienced matriarch, while adult males tend to live alone or in loose bachelor groups. In the wild, African elephants can live 60–70 years.

They are highly social animals, communicating through sounds, touch, and infrasound that can travel over long distances. Their daily food intake can reach 150 kilograms, and they may drink more than 200 liters of water per day.

This species is endangered. The main threats are habitat loss, fragmentation, and poaching for ivory.</br>
