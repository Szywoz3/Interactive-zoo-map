It is an excellent swimmer. When alarmed and fleeing from predators, it often seeks refuge in water.

It is the smallest representative of deer. Thanks to its small size, it moves easily through dense vegetation.

Adult males are solitary, while females with young form small herds. They communicate by producing high-pitched calls that resemble the sound of creaking doors.</br>
