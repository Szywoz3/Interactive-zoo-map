Seychelles - Frégate Island</br>

This extraordinary beetle, 3–4 cm long, is threatened with extinction due to its small range, habitat degradation, and invasive rats introduced by humans.
A group of enthusiasts from the London insectarium began breeding it.
About 100 individuals were obtained there, of which 10 were sent to our Zoo. We hope that through breeding, this species can be saved.</br>
