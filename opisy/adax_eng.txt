Addaxes obtain most of their water from the plants they eat. They drink very rarely and are adapted to withstand large temperature fluctuations.

Both males and females have horns; they are cylindrical, twisted, and curved backward.

They form small herds (5–20 individuals). Addaxes follow rainfall patterns and lead a nomadic lifestyle, moving to areas where vegetation appears after rain.

Addax hooves are flattened and widely spaced. This helps them move efficiently across sandy desert areas.</br>
