It is also called the Kamchatka eagle and ortan — one of the largest birds of prey in the world.

Sometimes it searches for fish by circling 6–7 meters above the water surface; once it spots prey, it dives down to catch it.

Females are heavier (6.8–9.0 kg) than males (4.9–6.0 kg), and their wingspan can reach about 195–245 cm.

In winter, birds of this species consume on average 0.8 kg/day, and in harsher conditions even up to 3.1 kg/day, of which half is given to their chicks.</br>
