The wolf plays an extremely important role in the ecosystem. By hunting large ungulates (deer, roe deer), it regulates their population. In this way, it prevents excessive destruction of forest areas by herbivores.

Together with other wolves, it forms a pack, called a "wataha". This is usually a family group, consisting of parents, young, and (sometimes) offspring from previous litters. A group can include up to 20 individuals.

Over distances, it communicates with the rest of the pack through a wide range of sounds: barking, howling, squeaks, and whining. It marks its territory with urine and feces. It also has a highly developed body language.

It is the ancestor of all modern domestic dogs. Domestication most likely took place 20–40 thousand years ago.</br>
