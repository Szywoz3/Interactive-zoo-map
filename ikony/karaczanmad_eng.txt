A large, herbivorous, wingless cockroach reaching up to 7 cm in length.
When disturbed, it escapes while loudly hissing. Males are distinguished from females by irregular bumps on the pronotum.
They are ovoviviparous. Females carry the egg case in a special brood chamber until embryonic development of the young is complete.
Then the larvae leave it and begin an independent life.</br>
