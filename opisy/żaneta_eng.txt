Cape genets are mainly nocturnal. During the day, they sleep high up in trees, on rock ledges, or in caves. They move primarily above the ground and are excellent climbers.
When walking along branches, genets keep low on bent legs to maintain balance. If they lose balance, they spread their legs outward.

Plants eaten by genets are not digested — they induce vomiting to remove toxins, indigestible hair masses, and feather remains from the stomach.

Pregnant females build nests in tree hollows, underground burrows, or among rocks. They usually give birth to two young.</br>
