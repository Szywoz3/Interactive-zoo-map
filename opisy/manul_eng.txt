lat. Otocolobus manul</br>
de. Pallaskatze</br>
ua. Манул</br>

Distribution: Central Asia</br>

Habitat: steppes, rocky and mountainous areas up to 4800 m above sea level</br>

Diet: small mammals, rodents, and birds</br>

The “plump” appearance of the manul is due to its very dense fur. It is the densest and longest (relative to body size) among all cats. The manul can withstand temperatures down to −50°C.

It is nocturnal. During the day, it rests hidden in caves, rock crevices, or abandoned burrows.

It prefers to hunt its prey from ambush. Its compact body makes running difficult.

In winter, its fur becomes uniformly gray. In summer, smaller stripes and lighter ochre-colored patches appear.</br>
