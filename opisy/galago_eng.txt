Like humans, monkeys, and lemurs, it belongs to the order of primates.
It leads an arboreal lifestyle — moving quickly through branches by running and leaping.
Its long tail helps maintain balance.

It builds nests from leaves. A few days after giving birth, the female carries her young in her mouth and places them on branches while foraging for food.

Although it cannot see in complete darkness, its large, dark eyes allow it to see even in very dim night light.</br>
