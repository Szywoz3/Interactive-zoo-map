Habitat: regenerating tropical forests (secondary forest) in protected areas</br>

Diet: grass, leaves, and tree buds</br>

Also known as the spotted sambar.

The population has declined to about 300 individuals, making them one of the rarest deer species in the world.
The causes are hunting and habitat destruction.
These deer were once considered extinct but were rediscovered during a biodiversity expedition on Negros Island in 2009.
Their population is beginning to recover in the wild thanks to breeding, protection, and habitat restoration programs.</br>
