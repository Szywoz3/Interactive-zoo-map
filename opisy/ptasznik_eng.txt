lat. Aviculariinae</br>

Spiders - Arachnids</br>

America</br>

This spider has venom capable of killing small birds, rodents, and lizards.
Indigenous people used its venom to poison arrows. Fragile hairs covering its body serve as a defense, causing skin irritation.
Bird spiders live in tree hollows, burrows, and rock crevices. They do not build webs but hunt actively.</br>
