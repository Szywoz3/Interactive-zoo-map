This species shows clear sexual dimorphism (differences in the appearance of the sexes). The female is brown-green, while the male’s plumage is dark, with a striking red crest on the head.

It forages mainly on the ground, rarely making use of its ability to fly.
Unlike other Galliformes, the chicks are fed by their parents beak-to-beak before they learn to scratch for food.

It is sometimes called “spurless.” This name is misleading, since it does have claws, and on the legs of males (as in other Galliformes), spurs occur.

It is threatened with extinction, mainly due to the loss of its natural habitat (deforestation and forest burning) and illegal trapping.</br>
