Distribution: Gran Chaco plains, on the border of Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina</br> 

Habitat: grasslands and swamps, near dry forests or savanna areas</br> 

Diet: insects – particularly ants and termites</br> 

They have strongly developed claws and forelimbs, but they do not dig their own shelters: instead, they use burrows abandoned by other species or hide under dense vegetation.
The southern three-banded armadillo and its close relative, the Brazilian three-banded armadillo, are endemic to South America. This means that in the wild, they are not found anywhere else in the world.
When threatened, they roll into a perfect ball, completely covered by a keratin armor – made of the same substance as human hair and nails.
The young are born blind, but they quickly learn to walk and to close their shell, which protects them not only from predators but also from heat loss.</br>
